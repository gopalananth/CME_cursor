## Code Review Findings by File

### 1. FormController.cs

#### **HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES**

**Security Vulnerabilities:**
- **File Upload Security**: No file type validation, size limits, or virus scanning
  - `SaveFile()` method accepts any file type without validation
  - Potential for malicious file uploads
  - Recommended: Implement file type whitelist, size limits, and security scanning

**Runtime Errors:**
- **Null Reference Exceptions**: Multiple potential null reference issues
  - Line 45: `leadData?.EmailSenton` accessed without null check
  - Line 47: `DateTime.UtcNow > expiryTime` could fail if `EmailSenton` is null
  - Recommended: Add proper null checks and validation

**Performance Issues:**
- **Large File Handling**: Files loaded entirely into memory
  - `GetFileFromUploadFolder()` reads entire file into byte array
  - Could cause memory issues with large files
  - Recommended: Implement streaming for large files

#### **MEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES**

**Code Quality:**
- **Magic Numbers**: Hardcoded values throughout
  - Line 47: `AddHours(48)` - should be configurable
  - Line 10: `Thread.Sleep(10000)` - arbitrary delay
  - Recommended: Extract to configuration constants

**Error Handling:**
- **Generic Exception Handling**: Catches all exceptions without specific handling
  - Line 500+: Generic exception handling in file operations
  - Recommended: Implement specific exception types and proper logging

**Code Duplication:**
- **File Processing Logic**: Repeated file handling code
  - Multiple similar file upload/save operations
